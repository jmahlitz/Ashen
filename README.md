Ashen
=====

Ashen is a Software for Managing Trampoline Tournaments from Trampolin Uni Stuttgart.

Why ?:
------
In the current situation the task of administrating registration, payment, billets, matching and ranking of a trampoline tournament a hell lot of work.
At the current situation we need around 4-6 people to do this stuff for 4-5 hours per day at tournament days. For example when a registration changes,
due to illness or similar events of the participants, people have to manually recalculate the bills for the whole University. And it is unquestioned that such bills have to be correct.

- more to follow in future

But what now ?
------
The idea is to create a software which can help automate the most time critical things such as automated registration, correct billing, matching and automated printing of the winners certificates.
When a future release is able to do such things, it could be developed much further.
Ideas for thr future could be:
- giving live data on the current tournament (points and ranking, for example over a beamer)
- app integration to check current tournament status and to see the list of start times
- automated payment integration
- status replies over mail (who is registered already, is our registration correct , are teams correct and so on)
